'met' : 'did not meet'} the passing threshold\r\n   - Sets a positive but honest tone appropriate for ${getStudentLevel()} students\r\n\r\n3. **Detailed Analysis:** 4-6 bullet points covering:\r\n   - Specific strengths demonstrated (reference actual criteria performance levels)\r\n   - Areas showing good progress or emerging skills (mention specific criterion names and levels achieved)\r\n   - Specific areas for improvement (be constructive, reference lower-performing criteria)\r\n   - Actionable suggestions for future work in ${courseName}\r\n   - Recognition of effort or growth where evident in the rubric selections\r\n\r\n4. **Conclusion Paragraph:** 2-3 sentences that:\r\n   - Reinforce ${studentFirstName}'s potential for continued growth\r\n   - Provide encouragement for continued development in the subject area\r\n   - Reference next steps or future assignments if relevant to ${assignmentTitle}\r\n\r\n**Context for Personalization:**\r\n- Student: ${gradeData.student.fullName}\r\n- Course: ${gradeData.course.code} - ${gradeData.course.name}\r\n- Assignment: ${assignmentTitle}\r\n- Instructor: ${gradeData.course.instructor}\r\n- Term: ${gradeData.course.term}\r\n\r\n**Tone Guidelines:**\r\n- Professional but warm and encouraging\r\n- Specific rather than generic (use actual criterion names and performance levels)\r\n- Growth-focused rather than deficit-focused\r\n- Appropriate for ${getStudentLevel()} students in ${courseName}\r\n\r\n**Avoid:**\r\n- Generic phrases like \"good job\" or \"needs improvement\"\r\n- Comparison to other students\r\n- Overly technical rubric language that students won't understand\r\n- Discouraging or harsh criticism\r\n- Repeating information already in the bullet points\r\n\r\n**Special Instructions:**\r\n${gradeData.gradeData.latePenaltyApplied ? `- Note: This assignment had a late penalty applied (${gradeData.gradeData.latePolicyDescription}).
